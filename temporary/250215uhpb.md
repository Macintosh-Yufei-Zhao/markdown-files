Good morning/afternoon, everyone! My name is Yufei Zhao, and I am a junior student at Yuanpei College, majoring in the Integrated Science Program. I have a strong passion for interdisciplinary research, particularly in the fields of biophysics, biomathematics, complex systems, network science, and systems biology.
My GPA is 3.668, and I am ranked 102nd in my college. Over the past academic year, I have achieved good grades in several core courses like Evolutionary Biology, Quantitative Genetics and Physical Chemistry in Cellular and Molecular Biology. I also took several courses in other related subjects like Quantum Mechanics, Equilibrium Statistical mechanics, and statistics in bioinformatics. These courses have provided me with a solid foundation and deepened my interest in interdisciplinary research.
In terms of research experience, I participated in the 2024 iGEM competition and was honored with a gold medal as part of Team Peking. I consider myself a quick learner, especially in math and physics. My dream is to find some kind of algorithm which could explain how living systems self-organize, evolve and achieve complicated functions with interdisciplinary sights, especially deterministic and stochastic dynamics.
I believe that my background and passion make me well-suited for pursuing interdisciplinary research. I am eager to contribute to the field by combining insights from different disciplines and exploring the intricate relationships within complex biological systems. Thank you for your attention!
